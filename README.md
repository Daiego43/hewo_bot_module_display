# Display Module
The display module opens up a pygame window. Pygame is really useful in this case since we need to spin the node for
each frame or game tick.

This window will open in full size with HeWo's Face, and all of it's features being published.

## Standalone Usage
In this first version, you can simply run HeWo as a videogame and test out it's face features 
in order to create emotions and expressions.
